<p>As required by the Evidence Act, agencies must conduct and provide an assessment of the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of their statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis efforts. The Capacity Assessment is intended to help agencies to assess their ability and infrastructure to carry out evidence building activities like foundational fact finding, performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluation.</p>
For additional details about the requirements of the Capacity Assessment, see: Appendix D of [OMB M-19-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf) and [Section 290 of A-11](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf#page=638).
