Agency Evaluation Policies, required by the Evidence Act for CFO Act agencies, must be established as a guide for the agency’s evaluation activities throughout the evaluation lifecycle. Evaluation policies should incorporate the evaluation standards described in [OMB M-20-12](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/M-20-12.pdf), as well as any other standards or principles deemed important for the agency.
<p>CFO Act agencies are expected to publish this document in February 2022. Evaluation.gov will be updated to provide active links to these agency documents as they become available.</p>
