- faq: What is a Learning Agenda, and what is the purpose of the questions available in the dashboard?
  answer: <p>Learning agendas, or evidence-building plans, provide an evidence-building roadmap to support effective and efficient agency functioning. Read more about Learning Agendas and other evidence planning documents required by the Evidence Act <a href="https://www.evaluation.gov/faqs/">here</a>.</p> <p>Learning Agendas are organized around priority questions that articulate where evidence is most needed to inform decision-making. The full Learning Agenda documents provide additional information about the agency’s plans to build evidence to address the question. Learning Agendas do not include answers to these questions; if the agencies had such answers, the questions would not reflect their highest priority evidence building needs.

- faq: How were questions selected for inclusion in the dashboard?
  answer: The dashboard includes all priority questions listed in the published Agency-wide Learning Agendas for CFO Act agencies. Some agencies structured their Learning Agendas with broad overarching questions that are then supplemented with a series of more focused questions. Both types of questions are included in the dashboard. 
- faq: Are these the only questions and topics of interest for these agencies?
  answer: No! The Learning Agenda process is intended to identify and focus attention on priority questions, and particularly those that align with agency Strategic Objectives. They reflect the strategic evidence planning process required by the Evidence Act. Additional evidence needs are also articulated through Annual Evaluation Plans, and other research planning documents developed by various offices within these Federal agencies.
- faq: How do I navigate the dashboard?
  answer: There are multiple ways to explore and filter the Learning Agenda questions.
  bullets:
    - bullet: To Filter by Agency&#58; Click on the agency “bubble” at the top or select the agency of interest from the list on the left-hand side (below Topic and Focus). Hover over small bubbles to see the label if it’s not visible.
    - bullet: To Filter by Topic&#58; Click on the topic “bubble” at the top right or select the topic of interest from the list on the left-hand side. Topics can be combined to view questions that are related to both topics by choosing one from the list and then another from the drop-down list where it says “combine with a second topic.” Alternatively, selecting one topic from the list and another from the bubbles will do the same thing.

    - bullet: To reset the list of questions either re-click the bubble selected, or clear or reset to “all” on the filters on the left-hand side.
- faq: I filtered the list for topics of interest to me, but no questions appeared on the screen. What happened?
  answer: If there are no questions that are tagged with the particular mix of topics selected, then none will appear on the screen. Reset the list of questions by either re-clicking the bubble selected, or unchecking any selected filters and checking “all” to reset the list and try a different filter.

  answer: Yes! When you identify Learning Agenda questions of particular interest, you can add them to your “list” by clicking on the question and then on “ADD TO YOUR LIST” in the pop-up box. Once you have identified your questions of interest, click on the button to “VIEW YOUR LIST” to see those questions you selected.
