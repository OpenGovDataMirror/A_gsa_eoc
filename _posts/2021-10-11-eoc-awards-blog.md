We are pleased to announce the winners of the Inaugural Evaluation Officer Council Recognition Program! These awards honor Federal civil service leaders committed to advancing evaluation and evidence-based policymaking across the Federal Government. The Evaluation Officer Council Recognition Program solicited nominations from both the Federal evaluation community and those who work with Federal evaluators. We received many strong nominations, and an inter-agency panel reviewed the submissions and provided recommendations. OMB presented the awards at the October Evaluation Officer Council meeting.  

Below we profile the winners of the 2021 Evaluation Officer Council Recognition awards. The profiles here highlight just some of their noteworthy and leading work in the Federal evaluation community. Their stories show the breadth and depth of Federal evaluation expertise and powerfully illustrate how agencies are using evaluation to improve government. We hope that reading these profiles will leave you as inspired as we were by the dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit of the Federal evaluation community!

Her leadership and high standards are improving capacity for robust (and causal) evidence-building activities that not only adhere to, but actively promote, the NSF Evaluation Policy principles. No one has worked more effectively to inculcate cross- and within-agency positive attitudes and energy toward building a culture of evidence for Federal Government decision-making.”</p>

<blockquote class="padding-bottom-2"><p>Rebecca has “been a lightning rod to evaluation capacity at DHS. In the Department of 250,000 people, there is not another that has substantively furthered evaluation capacity and education, especially in so short a time. Rebecca started at DHS as an OES Fellow on detail from NSF… I will admit… I was skeptical that one Evidence Fellow could have so substantive an impact on the department [that’s] a behemoth that we at OMB are often trying to maneuver… I wish it was possible to do an impact evaluation of Rebecca’s efforts, for I am certain, it would highlight the herculean effort and splendid effect she, singlehandedly, has had for the benefit of DHS and the public.”</p>

She has an incredible attitude and orientation for getting things done… being at a smaller agency, she wears many hats and is always game to scrub in… It would be easy for her to act as many others do across Government – noting that they have too much on their plates, are under-resourced and don’t have time to do one more thing… but her deep focus on how her office and work can support SBA’s mission lead her… During the COVID-19 pandemic [SBA] was able to leverage the system she helped architecture to understand common questions of the people they serve.”</p>
