Federal agencies recently published agency-wide [Learning Agendas]({{site.baseurl}}/evidence-plans/learning-agenda/) as required by the Evidence Act. Learning Agendas, or evidence-building plans, provide a roadmap to building the evidence that's critical for effective, evidence-based decision-making across Government. The plans include priority questions to address Federal agencies' most pressing evidence needs and provide additional information about how agencies plan to build evidence to address each question.

This [dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/learning-agenda-questions-dashboard/) compiles all of the agency Learning Agenda questions in one place so that you can easily explore where evidence is most needed. It also includes cross-agency Learning Agenda questions from the [President's Management Agenda Learning Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/pma/learning-agenda/){:target="_blank"}. The dashboard provides a dynamic, interactive way to sort and filter the questions by topic to identify shared areas of inquiry across agencies. The tool also allows you to select questions that are of particular interest, save them to a custom list, and download them.  We hope this dashboard offers a helpful way for researchers, community organizations, state and local governments, philanthropy, and the general public to engage with the Federal Government's evidence-building efforts.
